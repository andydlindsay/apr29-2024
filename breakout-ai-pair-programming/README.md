### Starter Prompt

```
Hi! I'd like to create a number guessing game in functional React. The computer will choose a number between 1 and 100. The player will then be able to make a guess. The computer will let the player know if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The player will have up to 5 guesses.

Could you please give us back a project outline/structure so that we know what we have to do to solve this problem?
