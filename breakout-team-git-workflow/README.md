## Team Git Workflow

### To Do
- [ ] Git vs Github
- [ ] Cloning vs Forking
- [ ] Merge Conflicts
- [ ] Team Git Workflow
- [ ] Other People's Branches

### Git vs Github
* git is a command line application that runs on your computer
* recording snapshots of code over time (commits)
* stored in a folder called .git
* Github is a website where we can remotely store repos
* collaborate with other devs

### Cloning vs Forking
* cloning => copy of a repo from Github to your local machine
* forking => creates a copy of a repo on Github
* "Use this template" => doesn't contain the commit history

### Merge Conflicts
* two or more devs changing the same code
* merge commit
* git log
* accept the current changes => keep my code
* accept the incoming changes => keep the code I'm pulling
* collaborate with the other dev

### Team Git Workflow
* one team member is going to use this template and own the repo
* add the other devs as collaborators
